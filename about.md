Hi! I am a Technical Architect with extensive experience on SAP Technology and very much interested in Cloud Technology. I help customers in their journey to SAP S/4HANA and Cloud Migration. I hold multiple SAP Certifications on SAP Cloud Tecnology and Google CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) certification. My recent project includes creating Cloud Native Applications for deployment on SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform) using SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and SAP Fiori Elements on Cloud Foundry environment and Kyma runtime.
